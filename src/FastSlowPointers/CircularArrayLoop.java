/**
 * Statement: Given a circular array of non-zero integers, nums, where each integer represents the number of steps
 * to be taken either forward or backward from its current index. Positive values indicate forward movement, while negative
 * values imply backward movement. When reaching either end of the array, the traversal wraps around to the opposite end.
 *
 * The input array may contain a cycle, which is a sequence of indexed characterized by the following:
 *              - The sequence starts and ends at the same index.
 *              - The length of the sequence is at least two.
 *              - The loop must be in a single direction, forward or backward.
 *  Constraints:
 *              1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
 *              -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
 *              nums[i] != 0
